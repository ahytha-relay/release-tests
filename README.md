# release-tests
The primary purpose of this repo is to test integration with [Intuit Auto](https://intuit.github.io/auto/docs)

Auto is used to generate the CHANGELOG.md file, as well as the tags/releases in this repository.
Optionally, I've started trying to incorporate release branches into the Auto process.

Auto is executed by a github workflow that executes any time new code is pushed to the main branch.
